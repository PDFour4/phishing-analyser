# Phishing Email Analyser

## Overview
Phishing Email Analyser is a web-based tool that allows users to upload email files for phishing analysis. The tool extracts email metadata, scans URLs using VirusTotal, and provides an easy-to-read report of potential threats.

## Current Features
- **Email File Upload**: Users can upload `.eml` or `.msg` files for analysis.
- **Metadata Extraction**: The tool extracts key details such as sender, subject, and email headers.
- **VirusTotal URL Scanning**: Detects malicious links by scanning them with VirusTotal.
- **Attachment Analysis**: Identifies potentially harmful email attachments.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple and intuitive UI for easy navigation.
- **Dockerized Deployment**: The application is containerized using Docker for easy deployment.
- **Hosted on Render**: The tool is live and accessible online for external users.
- **Saving Analysis Reports (PDF/JSON)**: Allow users to download or store reports for future reference.
- **Email Validation (Fake vs. Real)**: Implement checks to determine if an email is from a legitimate source.
- **Multi-Email Upload & Batch Processing**: Enable users to upload multiple emails at once for bulk analysis.

## Planned Features
To enhance functionality and user experience, we plan to implement the following:
- **Improve UI with Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS**:
  - Enhance design consistency and responsiveness.
  - Add **modals or tooltips** to explain the results and improve user experience.
